Nested Views with Backbone and Marionette
===============================================

This is the codebase for the second in a series of Backbone/Marionette tutorials. The first, [http://snowmonkey.parentleafarm.com/blog/2013/02/creating-a-deeply-nested-model-with-backbone-js/] (http://snowmonkey.parentleafarm.com/blog/2013/02/creating-a-deeply-nested-model-with-backbone-js/), dealt with deeply nested models in Backbone. This one, [http://snowmonkey.parentleafarm.com/blog/2013/02/views-with-deeply-nested-models/] (http://snowmonkey.parentleafarm.com/blog/2013/02/views-with-deeply-nested-models/), deals with the views that will be rendered, in keeping with said nested model.

The live result can be found here: [http://snowmonkey.parentleafarm.com/nested-layout/] (http://snowmonkey.parentleafarm.com/nested-layout/)

This tutorial will be part of a larger work, taking the process of building a complex, nested, single-page app with Backbone and Marionette. The purposes of this particular step are:

* To introduce some of the visual components of the target
* Examine the different view classes Marionette provides, and how they differ
* Look at a simple example of using Marionette's event aggregator, and why it matters
