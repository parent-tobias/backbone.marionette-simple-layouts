The purposes of this particular step are:\n\n* To introduce some of the visual components of the target\n* Examine the different view classes Marionette provides, and how they differ\n* Look at a simple example of using Marionette's event aggregator, and why it matters"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":1193,"length2":1235}]],"length":1235,"saved":false}
